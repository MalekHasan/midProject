# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

- Mohammad Abu Essa: Database Architect.
- Malek Hasan: Backend.
- Mohammad Zaytona & Helmi Qatqat: Frontend & Problem Solving.


**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

- Sketch the database design and scenarios of each user type.
- Determine the end points and middle-wares for each request that can occur on the client side.


**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

- In NoSQL libraries especially in MongoDB, improve the visualization of the scenarios of user's experience and enhance the problem-solving skills.


**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**

- An hour meeting at the beginning of each day to discuss the work to be done in that day, then working on each feature individually together.


## Conflict Plan


**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

-Our group will follow the GitHub workflow, allowing each member to work on their own branch, resolving conflicts through pull requests. Code reviews will be conducted before merging to maintain quality and mitigate conflicts.


**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**
- If one person dominates, we'll remind them of the collaborative nature of GitHub. All members should contribute via commits, pull requests, and reviews. If the issue persists, we'll discuss it as a team or escalate it to the project lead.


**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- We'll promote a culture of continuous learning, using code reviews and pair programming to share knowledge and skills. We'll divide tasks according to expertise and use the project's issue tracker to manage and prioritize tasks.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- We'll raise concerns about low contributions during regular check-ins, referencing the member's commit history. They'll be given a chance to improve. If there's no change, the issue will be brought up to the project lead.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

- If conflicts aren't resolved through team discussions and the GitHub workflow, we'll bring it to the attention of the project lead or supervisor. If it continues, we might consider mediation or reassigning team roles.


## Communication Plan

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

- We are typically available between 10 AM and 5 PM in our local time zone. However, these hours can be flexible based on project demands and team needs.

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

- We'll primarily use Slack or Telegram for day-to-day communication, GitHub for code-related discussions, and Zoom for scheduled meetings. Discord will serve as a backup communication method.

**How often will you take breaks?**

- It's good to take a short break every hour or so, and a longer break for lunch. This is flexible, though, and can be adapted based on workflow and task intensity.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- If we start to fall behind, we'll first evaluate the tasks at hand, prioritizing them, and possibly delegating tasks if appropriate. We'd communicate openly with each other about the issue and seek assistance or extensions if necessary.

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

- For after-hours communication, we'll mostly rely on asynchronous communication tools like discord or Slack where messages can be responded to when convenient. It's important to respect everyone's personal time and avoid unnecessary disturbances during off-hours unless in the case of an emergency.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- We will promote an open culture where everyone's input is welcomed and valued. Regular meetings will have dedicated time for open discussion, and online communication platforms can also be used for sharing ideas. We can also make use of anonymous feedback tools if necessary.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

- We will establish a set of team norms emphasizing respect, open-mindedness, and non-judgment. Encouraging active listening during discussions and handling disagreements diplomatically will be key. Anonymous feedback options can provide an additional safe avenue for input.


## Work Plan

**How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

- We'll start by breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks during our planning meetings. These tasks will be assigned based on each team member's skills and workload. We will track the progress of tasks using our project management tool, marking them as complete once they are finished and have passed review. Regular check-ins and meetings will provide opportunities for status updates and reassignment of tasks if needed.

**What project management tool will be used?**

- We'll use GitHub for code-related task management (via issues and pull requests), and supplement it with a tool like Jira or Trello for broader project management. These tools will help us monitor task statuses, manage backlogs, and visualize our workflow.


## Git Process

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

- The entire codebase, associated documentation, version history, and issue tracking will live on GitHub. This includes all branches, pull requests, code reviews, and any associated metadata.

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

- The repository will be created under an organization or a specific user account on GitHub. Teammates will then be invited as collaborators, giving them access to contribute.

**What is your Git flow?**

- We'll follow the Feature Branch Workflow. All feature development will happen on separate branches, created from the 'main' or 'develop' branch. Once a feature is complete, it will be merged back via a pull request.

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

- Yes, we'll use a PR review workflow to ensure code quality and consistency.

  **How many people must review a PR?**

  - Ideally, at least two team members should review each PR to ensure a broad perspective and catch potential issues.

  **Who merges PRs?**

  - After the required reviews and any necessary changes, the creator of the PR or a designated team lead can merge the PR.

  **How often will you merge?**

  - Merges will be made as and when features are completed and have passed review. This could be multiple times per day depending on the pace of development.

  **How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**

  - Once a PR has received sufficient reviews and any requested changes have been made, the PR creator can notify the team via GitHub, Slack, or email that the branch is ready to be merged. GitHub's notification system will also automatically alert relevant parties when PRs are ready.
